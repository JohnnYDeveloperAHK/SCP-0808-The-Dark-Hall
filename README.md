## Overview ( This description is subject to change, but this is what the project is "supposed" to follow.)

[first-person horror experience that plunges players into the depths of fear and darkness. In this game, you step into the shoes of Johnny, a part-time military worker and voluntary Operator Military Intelligence for Special Forces Serbia. What begins as a routine exploration of an unknown underground bunker takes a nightmarish turn when you enter the dreaded SCP-0808, known simply as the Dark Hall.

As Johnny, your only lifeline is your radio, a trusty M1911, and a *classified note that holds undisclosed secrets*. Guided by an enigmatic SCP operator, you venture into the abyss with nothing but your wits and courage. But what awaits you in the inky blackness of SCP-0808 is beyond comprehension.

The Dark Hall is shrouded in mystery, and no one knows what truly lurks within its depths. As you navigate the oppressive darkness, you'll encounter unnerving phenomena, eerie sounds, and a malevolent presence that hungers for your fear. Your only goal is to survive, to make it back to the entrance, and to uncover the chilling secrets hidden within the SCP-0808.]
